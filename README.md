# Icon-Automator-For-TP
I got tired of using photoshop, editing individual images in touch portal, for every button, so I (chatgpt) automated the process.

Auto installs python and necessary modules if needed
Starts script that prompts to select input dir, output dir, backup dir, png to overlay original img, and set corner roundness by % of img size.
Dir and roundess are saved and can be changed at any time via hotkeys shown on home console window.
Upon putting in a png, jpg, jpeg, or webp, into the input dir, the img is resized to 112 x 112, corners are rounded, overlay is put on, ie; blank glass button,
and 2 images are outputted.
The new png with the overlay for touchportal and the original is converted into a webp and backed up if changes are needed or needed for other uses.
And that's it! Got tired of doing this for every image, especially during streams, and now it takes seconds.
